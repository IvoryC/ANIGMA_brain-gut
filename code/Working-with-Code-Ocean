Working with Code Ocean and GitHub

This is not an authoritative document. These are notes about about what I have done to maintain this repo through both GitHub.com and code ocean, and how I think you can work with this repository yourself.

Easy way 1:
If the repository has a public code ocean capsule, use that.  You can make your own copy to modify.

Easy way 2:
If this repository is public:
Go to code ocean.
Create new capsule.
Create new capsule from public git.

Hard way:
If this repository is private:
Go to code ocean.
Create new capsule > new capsule.
Choose: Capsule > clone via git > copy url to clipboard.
In your local copy of your repository, 
  run: git remote add codeOcean <url>

If your main branch name (probably "main") does not match the code ocean repo name (probably "master"), create a new branch in your local repo with the matching name. For example:
  run: git checkout -b master

In the code ocean IDE, see any unsaved changed (indicated by yellow icons in the file menu).
In the code ocean IDE, make a commit, so there are no uncommitted changes.

In your local repo, on your "master" branch, rebase onto the existing code ocean commits:
  run: git checkout master
  run: git fetch codeOcean
  run: git rebase codeOcean/master

Now you can push to code ocean and it will be a fast forward change.
  run: git push codeOcean

Merging the two repos (this is has been a pain point):
Very helpful post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1425892/how-do-you-merge-two-git-repositories

cd path/to/project-b
git remote add project-a /path/to/project-a
git fetch project-a --tags
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories project-a/master # or whichever branch you want to merge
git remote remove project-a

they credit: https: //stackoverflow.com/questions/2949738/git-merge-different-repositories
and site git docs: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#git-merge---allow-unrelated-histories

Note: The --allow-unrelated-histories parameter only exists since git >= 2.9. See Git - git merge Documentation / --allow-unrelated-histories


Other notes:
Note: please add to Dockerfile:
rmarkdown_2.14 
(this is needed to render markdowns in the r studio workstation.)
